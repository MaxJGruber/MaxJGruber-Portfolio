Welcome to my Portfolio!

I created this basic portfolio to clearly show friends, family, colleagues and recruiters a short portrait of who I am.

I created this using basic HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap) and JavaScript.

Hi, I'm Maximilian. "Max" for short!

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer based in Paris, skilled in MERN stack, curious about and happy to explore other programming technologies.

Recently I've graduated from Ironhack's 9 week intensive Web Development Bootcamp, where I had a chance of not only learning full stack technologies, but also team programming, best coding practices and test driven development.

I'm fluent in English, French and German. Currently I'm looking for Full Stack, Back-end or Front-end job opportunities in Paris.

After 8 years working in the Hospitality Industry, I decided that 2020 would be my year to change careers in the hopes of rekindling my passion for hard work and productivity in the digital sector.
